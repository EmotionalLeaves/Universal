# Progress

Each round adds a short entry here: what was finished, and any known problems.

## Round 0 — An app that builds itself

**Status:** build 1 green.

Finished:
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app skeleton (`com.emotionalleaves.universe`, minSdk 26, targetSdk 35).
- Black home screen showing "Universe Explorer" and the installed version.
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`: builds a signed APK on every push to `main` and publishes it as a GitHub Release named `Build N`.
- Fixed signing key at `keystore/universe-explorer.jks` (non-secret on purpose, see PLAN.md). Version code = GitHub run number, so each build installs over the last.
- Crash screen: any crash is saved to a file; on the next launch the app shows the full error with Copy and Continue buttons.
- A small "Test crash screen" button at the bottom of the home screen to check the crash screen works. Remove it in Round 14.

Pinned versions: Gradle 8.11.1, Android Gradle Plugin 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.1.0, Compose BOM 2024.12.01, Java 17.

Phone checklist:
- [ ] The workflow turns green and a Release with an APK appears
- [ ] The APK installs and opens on your phone
- [ ] A second build installs over the first without uninstalling
- [ ] (extra) "Test crash screen" closes the app; reopening shows the crash screen; Copy works

Known problems: none yet.

## Round 1 — A 3D view you can touch

**Status:** build 2 green.

Finished:
- OpenGL ES 3.0 surface (`ui/UniverseView.kt`) with a renderer (`render/UniverseRenderer.kt`).
- Shader library with a logarithmic depth buffer (`render/Shaders.kt`), meshes, point batches.
- One lit, procedurally coloured planet and 6,000 background stars.
- Touch: one finger orbits (with coasting), pinch zooms (amplified, multiplicative), two fingers pan after a deliberate slide, twist rolls.
- On-screen frame rate, frame time and distance readout.
- Engine core in `core/` (doubles, big-range positions `UPos`, quaternions, units, seeded random, noise, orbital mechanics) is Android-free and compile-checked before every push.

Phone checklist:
- [ ] Controls feel smooth, and the counter stays near 60
- [ ] Rotating the phone doesn't crash the app

## Round 2 — The scale engine

**Status:** pushed.

Finished:
- `core/UPos`: positions as (integer cell of 2^40 m, double offset). Precise to well under 1 mm anywhere in the observable universe.
- Floating origin: every frame, positions are taken relative to the camera in doubles and only then turned into floats.
- Logarithmic depth buffer (vertex + fragment), infinite far plane.
- Camera zoom is multiplicative (pinch amplified ×2.2) with coasting, so speed scales with distance to what you are orbiting.
- Zoom slider on the right edge: logarithmic, from touching the surface to the whole observable universe.
- Scale readout (m, km, AU, ly, Mly, Gly) and a scale bar.
- Test scene: Earth-sized sphere, a 1 m orange cube on its surface, and a gold marker 10 billion light years away.
- Labels drawn over the 3D view, tap to select, double-tap or Fly To to travel, info card, Home button.
- Camera can't enter a planet.

Phone checklist:
- [ ] You can pinch from the cube to the far marker and back in under a minute
- [ ] Nothing shakes or flickers at any distance
- [ ] The scale readout changes units correctly
