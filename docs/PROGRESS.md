# Progress

Each round adds a short entry here: what was finished, and any known problems.

## Round 0 — An app that builds itself

**Status:** built, waiting for phone test.

Finished:
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app skeleton (`com.emotionalleaves.universe`, minSdk 26, targetSdk 35).
- Black home screen showing "Universe Explorer" and the installed version.
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`: builds a signed APK on every push to `main` and publishes it as a GitHub Release named `Build N`.
- Fixed signing key at `keystore/universe-explorer.jks` (non-secret on purpose, see PLAN.md). Version code = GitHub run number, so each build installs over the last.
- Crash screen: any crash is saved to a file; on the next launch the app shows the full error with Copy and Continue buttons.
- A small "Test crash screen" button at the bottom of the home screen to check the crash screen works. Remove it in Round 14.

Pinned versions: Gradle 8.11.1, Android Gradle Plugin 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.1.0, Compose BOM 2024.12.01, Java 17.

Phone checklist:
- [ ] The workflow turns green and a Release with an APK appears
- [ ] The APK installs and opens on your phone
- [ ] A second build installs over the first without uninstalling
- [ ] (extra) "Test crash screen" closes the app; reopening shows the crash screen; Copy works

Known problems: none yet.
